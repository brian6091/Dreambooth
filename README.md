# One script to rule them all

Fine-tune Stable diffusion models using [Dreambooth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12242), [Textual inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01618), [Custom diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04488), [Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685), and mixtures and variants thereof all in one place.

A quite skeletal notebook to get started:

Tested with Tesla T4 and A100 GPUs on Google Colab (some configurations will not work on T4 due to limited memory)

Tested with [Stable Diffusion v1-5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5), [Stable Diffusion v2-base](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-base), and [Stable Diffusion v2-1](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1).

Some unique features:
* **Advanced configuration:** Mix-and-match different fine-tuning methods ([LoRA](https://github.com/cloneofsimo/lora) X Dreambooth, Dreambooth X Textual inversion, etc)
* **Train only what you want:** 
* **Different loss criteria**
* **Continual learning**
* **Optimizer zoo:** In addition to the standard AdamW (and it's 8-bit variant), you can try out Dadaptation, 
* **Data augmentation:** such as random cropping, flipping and resizing, which can minimize manually prepping and cropping images in certain cases (e.g., training a style)
* Drop some text-conditioning to improve classifier-free guidance sampling (e.g., how [SD V1-5 was fine-tuned](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5))
* Image captioning using filenames or associated textfiles
* Multiple tokens for jointly training multiple concepts
* Inference with trained models uses [DiffusersðŸ§¨](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) pipelines, does not rely on any web-apps
